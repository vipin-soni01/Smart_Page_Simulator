COMPLETE GUIDE TO PAGE REPLACEMENT SIMULATOR
(Developed by Vipin Soni)
================================================================================
PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS (NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED)
WHAT IS RAM (MEMORY)?
RAM is your computer’s short-term memory. Think of it like a study table where you keep books you are currently reading.
* RAM is very fast
* RAM size is limited
* Programs must load into RAM to run
If RAM becomes full, the operating system must decide which data to remove.
WHAT IS VIRTUAL MEMORY?
Virtual memory is a technique that makes RAM appear larger than it actually is.
How it works:
1. Programs believe they have large memory
2. Only some parts (pages) are kept in RAM
3. Remaining data stays on disk
4. OS swaps pages between RAM and disk when needed
WHAT IS A PAGE?
Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages.
Example:
* Program needs 100 pages
* RAM can hold only 3 pages (frames)
* OS loads only 3 pages at a time
WHAT IS A PAGE FAULT?
A page fault occurs when a required page is not present in RAM.
Steps during a page fault:
1. Program requests a page
2. OS checks RAM
3. If page not found ? Page Fault
4. If RAM is full ? One page must be removed
5. The removal method depends on Page Replacement Algorithm
WHY PAGE REPLACEMENT MATTERS?
* Disk is much slower than RAM
* More page faults = Slower system
* Better algorithm = Fewer page faults
Your simulator demonstrates this concept practically.
================================================================================
PART 2: ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED IN THIS PROJECT

ALGORITHM 1: FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
CONCEPT: Remove the page that entered memory first.
REAL LIFE EXAMPLE:
Like a queue at a bus stop. The first person in line leaves first.
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Maintain pages in queue order
2. Remove the oldest page when replacement is required
PROS:
Simple and easy to implement
CONS:
Does not consider how frequently or recently pages are used

ALGORITHM 2: LRU (Least Recently Used)
CONCEPT: Remove the page that has not been used for the longest time.
REAL LIFE EXAMPLE:
Remove items from your bag that you haven’t used in a long time.
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Track last usage of each page
2. Remove the least recently accessed page
PROS:
Efficient in most practical cases
CONS:
Requires tracking usage history

ALGORITHM 3: OPTIMAL (Belady’s Algorithm)
CONCEPT: Remove the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
IMPORTANT:
This is theoretical and used as a benchmark.
HOW IT WORKS:
1. Look ahead in reference string
2. Remove the page whose next use is farthest
PROS:
Minimum possible page faults
CONS:
Cannot be implemented in real OS because future is unknown
================================================================================
PART 3: HOW TO USE THE SIMULATOR
STEP 1: RUN THE PROGRAM
Open terminal and type:
python main.py  
For console mode:
python main.py --console  
STEP 2: ENTER INPUT
Reference String:
Example ? 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2
Number of Frames:
Example ? 3
STEP 3: SELECT ALGORITHM
Choose:
FIFO
LRU
Optimal
Compare All
STEP 4: VIEW RESULTS
The simulator will display:
Step number
Current page
Frame status
Page Hit or Page Fault
Page Fault is marked when page is loaded from disk.
Page Hit means page already exists in memory.
================================================================================
PART 4: PERFORMANCE METRICS
The simulator calculates:
Total Page Faults
Total Page Hits
Hit Ratio
Fault Ratio
FORMULA:
Hit Ratio = (Page Hits / Total References) × 100
Lower Page Faults means better performance.
================================================================================
PART 5: SAMPLE TEST CASE
Reference String:
7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2
Frames:
3
Typical Results:
FIFO ? Higher faults
LRU ? Fewer faults than FIFO
Optimal ? Minimum faults
Observation:
Optimal always performs best because it knows the future.
================================================================================
PART 6: IMPORTANT VIVA QUESTIONS
Q: What is page replacement?
A: It is the process of selecting a page to remove from RAM when memory is full.
Q: Why is Optimal not used in real systems?
A: Because it requires future knowledge of page requests.
Q: Which algorithm performs better in practice?
A: LRU performs better than FIFO in most cases.
Q: What is Belady’s Anomaly?
A: A condition where increasing frames increases page faults in FIFO.
Q: What is locality of reference?
A: Programs tend to reuse recently accessed pages.
